# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SchematicAPI is a TypeScript library that enables developers to define their API contract once using Zod schemas and automatically generate both a type-safe API client for frontend applications and a functional mock server for development. The library aims to provide a single source of truth for API definitions while supporting modern development workflows with full type safety, automatic validation, and seamless integration with popular frontend frameworks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define my API schema in a single place using Zod schemas, so that I can maintain consistency between my client and server implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines API endpoints using Zod schemas THEN the system SHALL accept the schema definition in a standardized format
2. WHEN multiple endpoints are defined THEN the system SHALL support combining them into a unified API schema
3. WHEN the schema includes different HTTP methods THEN the system SHALL support GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH operations
4. WHEN the schema defines path parameters THEN the system SHALL support dynamic route segments with type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want an automatically generated type-safe API client, so that I can catch API-related errors at compile-time and have full IntelliSense support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API schema is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a fully typed API client
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the client SHALL provide compile-time type checking for requests and responses
3. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL show TypeScript errors at compile-time
4. WHEN the API client is used THEN it SHALL be framework-agnostic and work with React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a functional mock server generated from my schemas, so that I can develop and test my frontend without waiting for backend implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API schemas are defined THEN the system SHALL generate a Hono-based mock server
2. WHEN the mock server receives requests THEN it SHALL validate incoming data against the defined schemas
3. WHEN the mock server responds THEN it SHALL return data that conforms to the response schemas
4. WHEN the mock server is running THEN it SHALL be ready for immediate use in development workflows

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic data validation on both client and server, so that I can ensure data integrity throughout my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API client sends requests THEN it SHALL validate request data against the input schemas
2. WHEN the mock server receives requests THEN it SHALL validate incoming data and return appropriate error responses for invalid data
3. WHEN responses are received THEN the client SHALL validate response data against the expected schemas
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what validation rules were violated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate with Zod-compatible faker libraries, so that I can generate realistic mock data automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a faker function is provided THEN the mock server SHALL use it to generate data matching the Zod schemas
2. WHEN no custom mock is defined for an endpoint THEN the system SHALL automatically generate realistic fake data
3. WHEN the faker library supports the Zod schema types THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate data for strings, numbers, dates, arrays, and objects
4. WHEN generating fake data THEN the system SHALL respect Zod schema constraints like string length, number ranges, and regex patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to override default mock data with custom implementations, so that I can provide specific test scenarios and realistic data for my use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom mock functions are provided for specific endpoints THEN the system SHALL use them instead of auto-generated data
2. WHEN custom mocks are defined THEN they SHALL have access to request parameters, query strings, and body data
3. WHEN mixing custom and auto-generated mocks THEN the system SHALL support both approaches in the same mock server
4. WHEN custom mocks return data THEN it SHALL still be validated against the response schema

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add custom middleware to my mock server, so that I can handle CORS, authentication, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the mock server THEN the system SHALL provide a way to add custom Hono middleware
2. WHEN middleware is added THEN it SHALL be executed in the correct order for all requests
3. WHEN CORS middleware is needed THEN the system SHALL support adding appropriate headers
4. WHEN authentication middleware is added THEN it SHALL be able to intercept and modify requests before they reach the mock handlers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to add global request interceptors to my API client, so that I can modify outgoing requests with common headers like authorization tokens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request interceptors are registered THEN they SHALL be called for every outgoing request
2. WHEN an interceptor modifies the request THEN the changes SHALL be applied before the request is sent
3. WHEN multiple interceptors are registered THEN they SHALL be executed in the order they were added
4. WHEN an interceptor is removed THEN it SHALL no longer affect subsequent requests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to add global response interceptors to my API client, so that I can handle common responses like redirecting on authentication failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN response interceptors are registered THEN they SHALL be called for every incoming response
2. WHEN a response interceptor detects a 401 status THEN it SHALL be able to trigger navigation or other side effects
3. WHEN multiple response interceptors are registered THEN they SHALL be executed in the order they were added
4. WHEN an interceptor is removed THEN it SHALL no longer affect subsequent responses

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API client to work with any JavaScript frontend framework, so that I can use it regardless of my technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API client is imported THEN it SHALL not require any framework-specific dependencies
2. WHEN used with React THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with hooks, state management, and component lifecycle
3. WHEN used with Vue THEN it SHALL integrate properly with Vue's reactivity system and composition API
4. WHEN used with Svelte THEN it SHALL work with Svelte stores and component patterns

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined custom error classes for both mocks and API client, so that I can handle different error scenarios with proper typing and custom logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL throw custom error classes with specific types for different failure scenarios
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about which fields failed validation
3. WHEN network errors happen THEN the system SHALL distinguish them from validation and server errors
4. WHEN handling errors in TypeScript THEN developers SHALL have full type information about the error properties and methods
